    Everyone has something on their to-do list that they find intimidating, but is exactly the next step needed to grow (or start!) their business. Whether it’s outside of your comfort zone, just beyond your current know-how, or requires a deep dive into the unknown; these are the projects that make the most difference.
    <ul>
      <li>Wouldn’t it be great if whenever you were stuck you could ask an expert? </li>
       <li>How awesome would it be to get feedback (from people other than your friends) right away?
</li>
        <li>What if instead of raw inspiration, you got something done?!

    <h3>The People</h3>
    <p>Develop meaningful connections through working together. Forget the days of listlessly exchanging businesses cards by the conference bar. Showcase your creativity, dedication, and positive attitude through what you accomplish, and you’ll likely land your next client, collaborator, or friend.

</p>
     <h3>The Weekend</h3>
    <p>To break up the day, we’ll have lightning talks from your mentors. We want you to get some serious work done, so we have three hour sprints in between. </p>
  </div>

   <h3 class="FAQ">FAQ</h3>
    <h4>How much time will I get with the mentors?</h4>
<p>While there’s no hard and fast rule, the mentors are there to give insight, encourage you in the right direction, help fix an issue that’s tripping you up etc,... but then let you get back to work. Often 5 minutes of expert time can give you the confidence or technical tip you need to push through. Beyond 5-10 minutes, if others need help, mentors would step away and then check back to see your progress.</p>

    <h4>I doubt I’ll be able to finish my project in the weekend time, is that ok?</h4>
<p>If you don’t think you can finish it, pick a smaller aspect of the project that’s more achievable. Since you’ll have access to mentors, maybe segment a section of the project that’s more intimidating to you, and focus on that. </p>

<p>Example: Instead of designing a whole website, do just the landing page. A landing page defines the look of the whole site, and you’ll find the rest comes easier. On the flip side, if you’re dreading getting together the content, use the time to draft the copy/lay out images for your website. </p>

    <h4>Is food and drink provided?</h4>
    <p>Coffee, tea and filtered water are provided.</p>
