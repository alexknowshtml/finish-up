    <p>You probably have something on your to-do list that you find intimidating, but is <em>exactly</em> the step you know you need to take in your business, or your career.</p>
    <p><strong>You know the kind.</strong> </p>
    <p>Maybe it’s a set of tasks that requires new skills outside of your comfort zone, or just beyond your current know-how. Or you freeze when you think about taking a deep dive into the unknown to figure out what comes next. </p>

    <p>These are the projects that we know are most important...but we put them off, over and over and over.</p>

</p>
     <h3>The Weekend</h3>
    <p>To break up the day, we’ll have lightning talks from your mentors. We want you to get some serious work done, so we have three hour sprints in between. </p>

   <h3 class="FAQ">FAQ</h3>
  
    <h4>How much time will I get with the mentors?</h4>
<p>While there’s no hard and fast rule, the mentors are there to give insight, encourage you in the right direction, help fix an issue that’s tripping you up etc,... but then let you get back to work. Often 5 minutes of expert time can give you the confidence or technical tip you need to push through. Beyond 5-10 minutes, if others need help, mentors would step away and then check back to see your progress.</p>

    <h4>I doubt I’ll be able to finish my project in the weekend time, is that ok?</h4>
<p>If you don’t think you can finish it, pick a smaller aspect of the project that’s more achievable. Since you’ll have access to mentors, maybe segment a section of the project that’s more intimidating to you, and focus on that. </p>

<p>Example: Instead of designing a whole website, do just the landing page. A landing page defines the look of the whole site, and you’ll find the rest comes easier. On the flip side, if you’re dreading getting together the content, use the time to draft the copy/lay out images for your website. </p>

<h4>Is this mainly focused on people just starting out?</h4>
    <p>Nope! In fact, people with multiple businesses under their belt could possibly benefit even more!
      It's all too easy to get bogged down in commimtments for your other endeavors, and not spend the time to invest in the project you've always wanted to do or the next important step for growth.
    </p>

    <h4>Is food and drink provided?</h4>
    <p>Coffee, tea and filtered water are provided.</p>
